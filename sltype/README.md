# sltype

Package `sltype` provides type definitions for standard HLSL types, using aliases to the equivalent [mat32](https://cogentcore.org/core/mat32) types where possible, but including other type names not defined there.

These types will be converted to their equivalent HLSL types automatically by gosl, as will the corresponding `mat32` type names.
