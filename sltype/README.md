# sltype

Package `sltype` provides type definitions for standard HLSL types, using aliases to the equivalent [math32](https://cogentcore.org/core/math32) types where possible, but including other type names not defined there.

These types will be converted to their equivalent HLSL types automatically by gosl, as will the corresponding `math32` type names.
